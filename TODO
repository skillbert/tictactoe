deal with client disconnections
more descriptive gui
make sure we don't try to send something to a disconnected client

=== code cleanup ===
rename row,col,height to y,x,z and reorder them back to x,y,z

=== extensions ===
gui
more ai
make sure the server and client parse all possible input correctly (security, don't need ssl and stuff)
different board sizes   - protocol doesn't support
different player amount - protocol doesn't support

=== protocol fuckups ===
server:
	need a command to tell the player he entered the lobby (currently "lobby")
	don't autoqueue new clients on login as they won't be able to invite eachother
	needs a command to tell a client about an opponent leaving the game
client:
	need a command to leave a game
	
questions:
	do the clients automatically leave a game when it ends? this wouldn't give them a chance to look at the board in end state 
	what charset?
	message delimiter?
	invite stuff incomplete
	different board size not supported
