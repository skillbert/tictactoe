fix sending wins
leave game
send \n at the end of every message and fix being able to deal with them (probably implicit part of protocol since the assignments)
deal with client disconnections
more descriptive gui
make sure we don't try to send something to a disconnected client

=== code cleanup ===
merge remoteplayer and clientconnection classes
maybe move mark away from the player
rename row,col,height to y,x,z and reorder them back to x,y,z

=== extensions ===
gui
ai
make sure the server and client parse all possible input correctly (security, don't need ssl and stuff)
different board sizes   - protocol doesn't support
different player amount - protocol doesn't support
javascript/websocket support
